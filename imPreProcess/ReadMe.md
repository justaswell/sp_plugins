# imPreProcess (Single-Neuron Image Enhancement) 

imPreProcess is a Vaa3D plugin including a pipeline of image enhancement for single-neuron images. The aims is to enhance the neurite signal as well as to suppress the background, with the ultimate goal of high signal-background contrast and better within- and between image homogeneity. 

Please cite the following manuscript to use this plugin:

>  Guo et al. Image enhancement to leverage the 3D morphological reconstruction of single-cell neurons. Bioinformatics.

In this repo, we provide the following sources.

  * The source code for Vaa3D (vaa3d.org) plugin for image enhancement of single-neuron images.
  * Folder 'supporting_func': python code to benchmark image quality from the perspectives of signal-background contrast, dynamic range of  background/signal, for both within- and between-images.
  * Folder 'test_data': example image blocks from fMost image dataset of mouse brains.

## <a name="Installation"></a>Installation

 1. Please follow the build instructions here to build released plugins along with the Vaa3d main program:
         https://github.com/Vaa3D/Vaa3D_Wiki/wiki/BuildVaa3d.wiki

 2. Build this Vaa3D plugin following this wiki page: https://github.com/Vaa3D/Vaa3D_Wiki/wiki/CompilePlugins.wiki 
  

## <a name="Command"></a>Run via Command-Line Interface
  The plugin takes one 3d image and performs the enhancement according to the parameters specified by the user. It can be applied via either the GUI of the Vaa3D platform under the menu of 'plug-in/imPreProcess/image enhancement', or via the command line interface as following:
  
   * Window-based: 
        vaa3d_msvc.exe /x path_of_plugin_dll /f im_enhancement /i imput_image /o output_image /p parameter_list 
   * Linux/Mac-based: 
        vaa3d -x path_of_plugin_so -f im_enhancement -i imput_image -o output_image -p parameter_list

## <a name="Parameter"></a>Command-line parameters
      
   * input_image: 3d image to be enhanced (supported formats: .tif, .raw, .v3draw)
   * output_image: where to save the enhanced image (supported formats: .tif, .raw, .v3draw)
   * parameter_list: value of differet parameters, separated by space. Details are given as following

 
| Flag          | Usage                                                        | Default  |
| :------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ | -------- |
| --wxy_bilateral    | window size of bilateral filter along the x- and y-axis | 3 |
| --wz_bilateral         | window size of bilateral filter along the z-axis  | 1 |
| --sigma_color_bilateral | color sigma of bilateral filter | 35 |
| --gain_sigmoid_correction  | intensity gain for the sigmoid intensity adjustment | 5|
| --gain_sigmoid_correction  | image intensity in percentile, used as cutoff intensity of the sigmoid intensity adjustment | 25|
| --b_do_bf  | whether or not conduct bilateral filter during the enhancement, 1 yes, 0 no | 1 |
| --b_do_fft  | whether or not conduct high-pass filter during the enhancement, 1 yes, 0 no | 1 |

  * Note: The parameter_list should be specified in order as listed above. A typical example to run the command in Window OS with the parameter specification is as following:

     vaa3d_msvc.exe /x imPreProcess.dll /f im_enhancement /i 17109_4142.778_1929.072_2794.948.v3draw /o 17109_4142.778_1929.072_2794.948_pre.v3draw /p 3 1 35 3 25 1 1
